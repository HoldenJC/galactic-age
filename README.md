## Description

A website created with JS and HTML that allows the user to enter their age in Earth years and have their age in various other planet's years returned, as well as their life expectancy in those planet's years.

### Specs
| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| **Program takes an Earth years age and converts it to Mercury years age** | 24 (Earth years) | 5.76 (Mercury years) |
| **Program takes an Earth years age and converts it to Venus years age** | 24 (Earth years) | 14.88 (Venus years) |
| **Program takes an Earth years age and converts it to Mars years age** | 24 (Earth years) | 45.12 (Mars years) |
| **Program takes an Earth years age and converts it to Jupiter years age** | 24 (Earth years) | 284.64 (Jupiter years) |
| **Program will determine how many years input age has left to live on each above planet** | 24 (Earth years) | (world avg life expectancy = 72) 17.28 (Mercury years) - 5.76 (Mercury years) = 11.52 (Mercury years) left to live (...continued for rest of planets) |
| **Program will return number of years over life expectancy if input age has surpassed it already** | 75 (Earth years) | (world avg life expectancy = 72) 17.28 (Mercury years) - 18.0 (Mercury years) = 0.72 (Mercury years) over the average lifespan |
